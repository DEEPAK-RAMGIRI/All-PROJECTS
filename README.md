# My Projects

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
Welcome to my **Projects** section â€” a curated collection of my best work, where I showcase hands-on learning, creativity, and technical skills across different domains.

# 1. [Hotel Brochure Design](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGIq3OqnRM/GYtdP6tfdcAs62uNdLqeNA/edit?utm_content=DAGIq3OqnRM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

This is a hotel brochure designed using **Canva**, aimed at presenting key features of a hotel in a visually appealing and professional layout. The design focuses on clarity, structure, and hospitality branding.
