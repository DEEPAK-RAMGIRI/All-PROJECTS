### 4. [Song Recommendation System](https://github.com/DEEPAK-RAMGIRI/Song-Recommendation-System)
This project is a simple content-based song recommender using song lyrics. It preprocesses lyrics, converts them into TF-IDF vectors, and uses cosine similarity to suggest songs with similar lyrics. Built with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, it analyzes a sample of 25,000 songs for fast and meaningful recommendations.

### 9. [QR-CODE GENERATOR](https://github.com/DEEPAK-RAMGIRI/PROJECTS/tree/main/QR-CODE)
This project is a web-based QR code generator that allows users to enter any URL and instantly receive a corresponding QR code. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses a serverless function on Vercel with the qr-image library. When a URL is submitted, the serverless function generates a PNG QR code, encodes it in Base64, and returns it to the browser, which displays it immediately without reloading the page. The project is lightweight, secure, and easy to deploy.

### 10. [RE-VIEW](https://github.com/DEEPAK-RAMGIRI/RE-VIEW)
RE-VIEW is a personalized media review web app inspired by IMDb, where users can save, rate, and describe their favorite scenes from movies, anime, series, or novels. The idea came from my habit of capturing memorable moments and wanting a platform to organize them. As a beginner in Node.js and full-stack development, I built this using Vibe Coding for AI-assisted implementation. The project uses React for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB Atlas for the database. It reflects my creative journey of turning ideas into a functional full-stack application.

Foodies 2.0 is a responsive online restaurant app where users can explore menus, view dish details, add items to the cart, and place orders seamlessly. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it ensures a smooth user experience. The app includes a Dialogflow chatbot for interactive support, with the frontend on Vercel, backend on Render, and MongoDB managing menu and order data.
