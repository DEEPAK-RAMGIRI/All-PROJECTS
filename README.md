Built with Pandas, Scikit-learn, and NLTK, it analyzes a sample of 25,000 songs for fast and meaningful recommendations.

### 9. [QR-CODE GENERATOR](https://github.com/DEEPAK-RAMGIRI/PROJECTS/tree/main/QR-CODE)
This project is a web-based QR code generator that allows users to enter any URL and instantly receive a corresponding QR code. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses a serverless function on Vercel with the qr-image library. When a URL is submitted, the serverless function generates a PNG QR code, encodes it in Base64, and returns it to the browser, which displays it immediately without reloading the page. The project is lightweight, secure, and easy to deploy.
